## Getting Started

### Setting up the client

`EMAIL` and `PASSWORD` correspond to the credentials you use to log in at [https://network.quakesaver.net](https://network.quakesaver.net).

```python
from quakesaver_client import QSCloudClient

EMAIL = "user@yourorganisation.net"
PASSWORD = "!verstrongpassword1"

client = QSCloudClient(email=EMAIL, password=PASSWORD)
```

### Full example script

Authenticate against the quakesaver server and download raw, as well as processed data.

Please note, that for security reasons each login session is only valid for 15 minutes. Thus, the client is not designed for long-term connections but for repeated queries.

```python
